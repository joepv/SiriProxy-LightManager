I tried to program the commands to be as natural as possible, so the plugin listens to simple keywords. Therefore I created two speaking scenario's for each ON/OFF/DIM command with regex patterns.

For example you can say:

a) Please turn on the lights above the table.
b) Turn the lights above the table on.
